Hi, I'm Jake Adams!

I'm a software engineer based in Rochester, New York. I've been passionate about programming since I was a teenager, and I've been working professionally in the field since 2019.

I love building software that makes a difference, and I'm always excited to learn new technologies and solve challenging problems.
